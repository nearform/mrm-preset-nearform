# NearForm MRM Preset
This a tasks preset for the [mrm](https://mrm.js.org/) library, used to transform a repository
into one of the following: 

1. `GitHub Action` project, by adding the following features:
    - an automatic GitHub release action
    - bundling on commit, set up with [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc)
    - tests with [jest](https://jestjs.io/) along with necessary linting changes and transpilation setup
2. ...

## Using this task
Simply run the following command in your project's root:

```shell
npx mrm $TASK_NAME --preset nearform --interactive
```

Where `$TASK_NAME` is one of the following: 
1. `github-action`.
2. `fastify-plugin`
3. `aws-cdk`

If this is the first time you're using `mrm` you will be asked for permission to install it, and the interactive setup 
will begin.

## Development
Assuming that the repository you're setting up is checked out next to this project, e.g.:
```
Users
  yourusername
    mrm-preset-nearform
    your-repository
```
and that your current working directory is:
```
/Users/yourusername/your-repository
```

the easiest way to test the local version of this task is to reference it directly from the file system:

```shell
npx mrm $TASK_NAME --preset ${PWD}/../mrm-preset-nearform --interactive
```
